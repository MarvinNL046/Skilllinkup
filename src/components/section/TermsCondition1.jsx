                  Welcome to SkillLinkup. By accessing or using our platform at
                  skilllinkup.com, you agree to be bound by these Terms of
                  Service. SkillLinkup is a marketplace that connects
                  freelancers with clients seeking professional services.
                </p>
                <p className="text fz15">
                  If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use our
                  platform. We may update these terms from time to time, and
                  continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of any
                  changes.

                <h4 className="title mb15">2. Account Registration</h4>
                <p className="text fz15 mb15">
                  To use certain features of SkillLinkup, you must create an
                  account. You agree to provide accurate and complete
                  information during registration and to keep your account
                  credentials secure. You are responsible for all activity that
                  occurs under your account.
                </p>
                <p className="text fz15">
                  You must be at least 18 years old to create an account. Each
                  person may only maintain one account. We reserve the right to
                  suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.

                <h4 className="title mb15">3. Freelancer Services</h4>
                <p className="text fz15 mb15">
                  Freelancers on SkillLinkup are independent contractors, not
                  employees of SkillLinkup. Freelancers are solely responsible
                  for the quality and delivery of their services, including
                  compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
                </p>
                <p className="text fz15">
                  SkillLinkup does not guarantee the quality, safety, or
                  legality of services offered by freelancers. Clients are
                  encouraged to review freelancer profiles, ratings, and
                  reviews before engaging their services.
                </p>

                <h4 className="title mb15">4. Payments and Fees</h4>
                <p className="text fz15 mb15">
                  All payments between clients and freelancers are processed
                  through our secure payment system. SkillLinkup uses an escrow
                  system to protect both parties: funds are held until the
                  client confirms satisfactory delivery of services.
                </p>
                <p className="text fz15">
                  SkillLinkup charges a service fee on transactions. Fee rates
                  are displayed before you confirm any payment. Freelancers
                  receive their earnings after the service fee is deducted and
                  the client approves the work.
                </p>

                <h4 className="title mb15">5. Refunds and Disputes</h4>
                <p className="text fz15 mb15">
                  If a dispute arises between a client and freelancer,
                  SkillLinkup provides a dispute resolution process. Both
                  parties are encouraged to resolve issues directly first. If
                  no resolution is reached, SkillLinkup may mediate and make a
                  final decision.
                </p>
                <p className="text fz15">
                  Refunds may be issued at SkillLinkup&apos;s discretion based
                  on the circumstances of the dispute, including evidence of
                  non-delivery, significant quality issues, or breach of the
                  agreed scope of work.

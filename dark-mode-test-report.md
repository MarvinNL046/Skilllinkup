### 2. Platforms (/platforms) - ❌ FAIL

**Screenshot:** `.playwright-mcp/platforms-dark-after.png`

**Critical Issues Found:**

#### Issue #1: Platform Cards Using Light Gray Background
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **Location:** Platform cards (Toptal, Arc, Dribbble, etc.)
- **Problem:** Cards are using `bg-gray-400` or similar light backgrounds instead of dark
- **Expected:** Dark card backgrounds (e.g., `dark:bg-slate-800` or `dark:bg-slate-700`)
- **Current:** Light gray (#9ca3af or similar)

**Verification Checklist:**

**Quality Score:** 4/10 (critical issue prevents passing)

**Root Cause:**
The platform cards component is not applying dark mode classes or is using hardcoded light colors.

**Required Fix:**
Update the platform card component to use dark mode backgrounds:
```tsx
// Current (WRONG):
className="bg-gray-400 rounded-lg p-6"

// Should be (CORRECT):
className="bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg p-6 border border-gray-200 dark:border-slate-700"
```

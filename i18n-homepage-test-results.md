## Verified Translation Keys

The following translation keys are working correctly:

**Hero Component** (`components/hero.tsx`):
- ✅ `hero.badge` - Badge text
- ✅ `hero.title` - Main heading
- ✅ `hero.cta.browse` - Primary button
- ✅ `hero.cta.compare` - Secondary button

**HowItWorks Component** (`components/how-it-works.tsx`):
- ✅ `howItWorks.title` - Section heading

---

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Initial Build Cache Issue (RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Server returned 500 errors for both locales  
**Error**: `Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/@formatjs.js'`  
**Root Cause**: Stale Next.js build cache (`.next` directory)  
**Solution**: Cleared `.next` directory and restarted server  
**Result**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. Playwright MCP Tool Not Available (BLOCKING)

**Problem**: Task specified using "Playwright MCP" for visual testing  
**Impact**:
- Cannot capture screenshots
- Cannot verify visual layout
- Cannot test component rendering
- Cannot provide visual evidence

**Workaround**: Used HTML content verification with `curl` and `grep`  
**Limitation**: No visual proof of correct rendering

---

## Testing Methodology

Since Playwright MCP was not available, I used the following approach:

```bash
# 1. Check HTTP status codes
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/en
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/nl

# 2. Verify text content exists in HTML
curl -s http://localhost:3000/en | grep "Find Your Perfect"
curl -s http://localhost:3000/nl | grep "Vind Jouw Perfecte"

# 3. Check for specific translation keys
curl -s http://localhost:3000/en | grep -c "Updated Daily"
curl -s http://localhost:3000/nl | grep -c "Dagelijks Bijgewerkt"
```

---

## What Was NOT Tested

Due to lack of Playwright MCP access:

1. ❌ Visual screenshots of both language versions
2. ❌ Component layout verification
3. ❌ Visual comparison between EN and NL versions
4. ❌ Screenshot evidence saved to `.playwright-mcp/` folder
5. ❌ Interactive element testing (button clicks, navigation)
6. ❌ Language switcher functionality
7. ❌ Responsive design verification

---

## Recommendations

### For Complete Testing

To fully test the i18n implementation, the following is needed:

1. **Configure Playwright MCP** - Required for visual testing
2. **Capture Screenshots** - Both EN and NL versions
3. **Test Language Switcher** - Verify switching between locales
4. **Test Navigation** - Verify all links work in both languages
5. **Responsive Testing** - Verify layout on mobile/tablet/desktop

### For Future i18n Testing

Create an automated test suite that:

1. Uses Playwright to capture screenshots automatically
2. Verifies all translation keys are present
3. Tests language switcher functionality
4. Validates routing works correctly (`/en/*` and `/nl/*`)
5. Checks for untranslated content

---

## Final Status

**Text Content**: ✅ PASS (100% of checked translations working)  
**HTTP Status**: ✅ PASS (Both locales return 200 OK)  
**Visual Testing**: ⚠️ INCOMPLETE (Playwright MCP not available)  
**Screenshots**: ❌ NOT CAPTURED (Tool limitation)

**Overall**: ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS with limitations

---

## Conclusion

The homepage i18n implementation appears to be **functionally correct** based on HTML content verification. All checked translation keys are present and working in both English and Dutch versions.

However, **visual verification is incomplete** due to the lack of Playwright MCP tool access. To confirm that the translations render correctly and the layout is as expected, visual testing with screenshots is required.

**Recommendation**: Configure Playwright MCP and re-run this test suite to capture visual evidence and complete the testing process.
